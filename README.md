# Web APIs: Code Quiz :

Created an application for coding assessment, with timed code quiz that's made up of multiple-choice questions. The app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by my JavaScript code. It has a clean and polished user interface and is responsive, which ensures that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

## Description :

This application is made for user to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores SO THAT user can gauge his/her progress compared to peers.

## Acceptance Criteria :

- WHEN the Start button is clicked THEN a timer starts and User is presented with a question.
- WHEN User answer a question THEN User is presented with another question.
- WHEN User answer a question incorrectly THEN time is subtracted from the clock.
- WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0 THEN the game is over.
- WHEN the game is over THEN User is asked to enter initials.
- WHEN User submit the result THEN initial and score is stored in local storage.
- WHEN data is stored in local storage THEN a new page is loaded with all the scores.
- WHEN highscore page is loaded THEN User can go back to main page to retake quiz or clear all the highscore from local storage.
